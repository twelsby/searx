* You can build the docker container locally by running (check out base branch for the alpine base with the needed python packages): ```docker build --pull -f ./Dockerfile -t searxng-dev:latest .```

* Debug the local container with: ```docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 searxng-dev:latest```

* ```IMAGE_PROXY``` : enable the image proxyfication through SearXNG; the builtin image proxy is used (set this to `true`)
